What's Turms?
-
Turms is a program for OS X and iOS that allows you to securely collect your thoughts, wherever you are.


Who's Turms?
-
Turms was the Etruscan god of trade and the messenger god between people and gods.


What does?
-
Start collectiong your thoughts, wherever you are. Collect photos, links, video and audio clips.

All your data will be seamlessly synced via iCloud to every iPhone/iPad or Macintosh you have. Don't forget anymore the thing you was thinking about this morning, when, in the evening, you are on your mac writing that clever post.

Encryption
-
Your notes text will be encrypted on your iCloud storage so to avoid the eavesdroppers. The Encryption Key is setup on the preference screen. Please choose a strong password and note it somewhere. Remember that your notes will *not* be readable anymore without the password! Don't lose or forget it! You've been warned. :)

The encryption password is available in clear in the software and can be freely changed. It is saved in the System Keychain and, therefore, it is sure when the device is locked (as it should always be when not in use). The cloud storage (the real target of encryption) is always encrypted without any copy of the password. We feel this is the right balance between usability and security.

Please note and be aware that the note title and the attachments are not encrypted in any case: only the note text is encrypted.

Text is encrypted with the Apple's CommonCrypto library using AES-256 with the help of the RNCryptor library. The relevant (d)encrypting code fragments will be available on the app website.


Privacy
-
We understand that thoughts, notes, and things are a very personal thing and we tried very hard to have your data as safe as possible. The Macintosh version is fully sandboxed and have no access to anything else than the attachments you added to the notes (a copy of them, stored with the notes). The iPhone/iPad versions can be locked with a PIN, requested everytime on app startup.

If you're privacy-conscious you should lock your iPhone with a code (this will encrypt the notes' cache on your iPhone) and use FileVault on your Macintosh. Remember to lock your devices when you leave them. Because we have no copy of your data, we cannot decrypt your notes in case you lose the password. Really. So, again, don't lose your password!

Both iOS and Mac apps do not "phone home" nor access anything else. There is no analytics package nor ads for this reason. That means that we have no idea on how you use the app and what is happening. Please send your feedback and suggestions to gt@iltofa.com via email or @g2fano via twitter.

Ads are served by default on iOS using the Apple's network (iAd), no additional information will be gathered by any other third party.

Thank you and _happy collecting_!
