Why Janus?
-
Janus Notes is a note taking program for iOS and OSX that seriously respect your right to privacy.
It is named after the Latin God *Janus*, depicted as having two faces since he looks to the future and to the past. Or, may be, cloud storage and privacy. Or Macintoshes and iPhone/iPad. Or sharing and control.

Basic
-
To start simply add a note and begin writing. We're supporting plain text and markdown with preview (live preview on Macintosh).

You can add attachments to the notes and they will live side by side with your notes. On Macintosh press '+' (or drag and drop a file) to attach it. On iOS you can attach a picture (from library or camera), a link or taking a voice note. Tap the attachment to see it on iOS. Double click or right click the icon on Mac to open or edit it.

Notes Sharing
-
You can share the notes among different Macs and to your iDevices using Dropbox.
If you want to share also with your iPhone and/or iPad, start from the iDevice: start tapping the Prefs button and then tap the "Start notes Sync With Dropbox" button. Simply provide your account information and you're done. Make the same on the other iDevices you have and your data will be seamlessly synchronized through dropbox. Keep in mind that before starting attaching other devices is always preferable to wait until the first sync is terminated completely. On iOS the header in the note list will show "Notes âœ”", on Macintosh simply check the dropbox menu.

To share notes with your Macintosh, after initing the Dropbox sync on your iPhone/iPad, simply go (on the Mac) to "Prefs" and then go to your dropbox folder, then to the folder "Apps" and then to the folder "Janus-Notes". Select it and you're done.

If you are sharing only among Macs, you can simply create a folder under your dropbox folder and select it from the preferences from all the Macintoshes involved.
In case something doesn't work (say missing notes, etc.) the key is waiting. When the sync will be complete all will be hopefully OK.

Encryption
-
Your notes can be encrypted on your dropbox so to avoid the eavesdroppers.

To encrypt your notes select "Encrypt Notes" from the preferences and enter a password. Please choose a strong password and note it somewhere. Remember that your notes will *not* be readable anymore without the password! Don't lose or forget it! You've been warned. :)

When you start the encryption process, be sure that only one Janus is running and, after initing the process, please wait for the sync termination before opening other Janus on other devices.

When the notes are encrypted, the other devices will ask you for the same password. Please be patient because, especially on iOS, you could be asked twice (or thrice) for the password. This happens because the sync is still running and the notes are in a "mixed" state. Simply wait a little before re-entering the password again. If you enter the wrong password, you will be simply asked again for it.

The encryption password is available in clear in the software and can be freely changed. It is saved in the System Keychain and, therefore, it is sure when the device is locked (as it should always be when not in use). The cloud storage (the real target of encryption) is always encrypted without any copy of the password. We feel this is the right balance between usability and security. This could be changed in the next versions.
Please note that attachments are not encrypted in any case.

Privacy
-
We understand that note-taking is a very personal thing and we tried very hard to have your data as safe as possible.

We have **no** access to your dropbox beside the specific folder that we use for storing notes. Your data is safe.
The Macintosh version is also fully sandboxed and have no access to anything else than the dropbox folder you choose and the attachments you added to the notes (a copy of them, stored with the notes).
If you're privacy-conscious you should lock your iPhone with a code (this will encrypt the notes' cache on your iPhone) and use FileVault on your Macintosh. Remember to lock your devices when you leave them.
Because we have no copy of your data, we cannot decrypt your notes in case you lose the password. Really. So, again, don't lose your password!

Both iOS and Mac apps do not "phone home" nor access anything else. There is no analytics package nor ads for this reason. That means that we have no idea on how you use the app and what is happening. Please send your feedback and suggestions to gt@iltofa.com via email or @g2fano via twitter.

Thank you and _happy notes_!
